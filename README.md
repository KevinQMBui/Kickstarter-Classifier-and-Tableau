# Kickstarter-Classifier-and-Tableau
I cleaned and modified the "Kickstarter Project" dataset from Kaggle in order to implement a random forest machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a Kickstarter project will fail or succeed. In addition, I also made an interactive visualization on Tableau to analyze revenue and project state.
